## Ideas
 - Powerups to keep things interesting: Shoot, shield, etc...
 - Alternate disc throwing game wars (boomerang fu)
 - Snake mode or fixed trail length mode or no collide own tail mode or fill the box grid game mode or grow biggest mode
 - Something more visually interesting: Shader, ASCII terminal vibes, 
 - Campaign about hacking into core memory, snarky things said in chat, map overview of progress, OR turn-based overworld?
 - Race through interesting platformer levels?
 - Obstacles, platforms, voids in map OR Side scroller instead
 - Break out of grid?
 - Tank mode - Move slowly but shot gun?
 - Light sail rider mode? Light sail to get to the next level?
 - Metroidvania LOL
 - Try camera that follows player...
